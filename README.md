# Test Drive

12 April 2020

This Git repo contains my public notes, some of which I might turn
into blog posts in future. Notes are written in Markdown.

I use Windows, Android and iPad to write notes. On Windows I use
Git Bash, Github Desktop, and VS Code. On Android and iPad, I am
experimenting GitJournal.
